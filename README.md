# Basic EDA Analysis and-Descriptive Statistics


Description:
The data we’re going to work with comes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) program at the CDC. You can read a lot more about NHANES on the CDC’s website or Wikipedia.

In this project only some of the variables provided in the original dataset will be used. These variables are taken from the 2011-12 survey years on approximately 5000 individuals. The CDC uses a sampling strategy to purposefully oversample certain subpopulations like racial minorities. Naive analysis of the original NHANES data can lead to mistaken conclusions because the percentages of people from each racial group in the data are different from general population. The 5,000 individuals here are resampled from the larger NHANES study population to undo these oversampling effects, so you can treat this as if it were a simple random sample from the American population.


CODE WILL SOON BE UPLOADED
